# Welcome to steam.py's documentation

steam.py is a modern, easy to use, and async ready API wrapper for the Steam API and its CMs. Heavily inspired by
[discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) and borrowing functionality from
[ValvePython/steam](https://github.com/ValvePython/steam).

## Key Features

- Modern Pythonic API using `async`/`await` syntax
- Command extension to aid with bot creation
- Easy to use with an object-oriented design
- Fully typed hinted for faster development
