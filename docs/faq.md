## General

These are some general questions relating to steam.py

### How much Python do I need to know?

This is not obviously required but it should make working with the library significantly simpler. Properly learning
Python will both prevent confusion and frustration when receiving help from others but will make it easier when reading
documentation and when debugging any issues in your code.

### How can I get help with my code?

**Things to avoid:**

- Truncate the traceback, as you might remove important parts from it. If it isn't something that should be kept
  private like your username, password etc. include it.
- Send screenshots/text files of code/errors unless relevant as they can be difficult to read.
- Uploading a text file. Instead, you could use any of:
  - <https://mystb.in>
  - <https://gist.github.com>
  - <https://hastebin.com>
- Ask if you can ask a question about the library as the answer will always be yes.
- Saying "This code doesn't work" or "What's wrong with this code?"
  - This is not helpful for yourself or others. Describe what you expected to happen and/or tried (with your code),
      and what isn't going right. Along with a traceback (if applicable).

### How can I wait for an event?

```python
import asyncio

import steam
from steam.ext import commands


bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix="?")


@bot.command
async def trade(ctx: commands.Context):
    def check(trade: steam.TradeOffer) -> bool:
        return trade.user == ctx.author

    await ctx.send("Send me a trade!")
    try:
        offer = await bot.wait_for("trade", timeout=60, check=check)
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        await ctx.send("You took too long to send the offer")
    else:
        await ctx.send(
            f"You were going to send {len(offer.receiving)} items\n"
            f"You were going to receive {len(offer.sending)} items"
        )
        await offer.decline()
```

The final interaction will end up looking something like this:

- ?trade
- Send me a trade!
- User sent a new trade offer
- You were going to send 3 items. You were going to receive 5 items

### How do I send a trade?

Sending a trade should be pretty simple.

- You need to first get the inventories of the User's involved.
- Then you need to find the items to trade for.
- Construct the TradeOffer from its items.
- Finally use the {meth}`~steam.User.send` method on the User that you want to send the offer to.

```python
# we need to choose a game to fetch the inventory for
game = steam.TF2
# we need to get the inventories to get items
my_inventory = await client.user.inventory(game)
their_inventory = await user.inventory(game)

# we need to get the items to be included in the trade
keys = [item for item in my_inventory if item.name == "Mann Co. Supply Crate Key"][:3]
earbuds = utils.get(their_inventory, name="Earbuds")

...  # handle degenerate cases len() != 3 and earbuds are None

# finally construct the trade
trade = steam.TradeOffer(sending=keys, item_to_receive=earbuds, message="This trade was made using steam.py")
await user.send(trade=trade)
# you don't need to confirm the trade manually, the client will handle that for you
```

### What is the difference between fetch and get?

- **GET**
  : This retrieves an object from the client's cache. If it happened recently, it will be cached. So this method is best
    in this case. This is also the faster of the two methods as it is a dictionary lookup.
- **FETCH**
  : This retrieves an object from the API, it is also a [coroutine_link] because of this. This is good in case
    something needs to be updated, due to the cache being stale or the object not being in cache at all. These, however,
    should be used less frequently as they are a request to the API and are generally slower to return values. Fetched
    values aren't added to cache.
