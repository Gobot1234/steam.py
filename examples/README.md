These are a specially curated collection of programs written with steam.py. More information about any of the functions
used can be found in [the documentation](https://steam-py.github.io/docs/latest).

More examples should be coming soon.

- For a basic bot using `ext.commands`, see [`basic_bot.py`](basic_bot.py).
- For a client that automatically replies to messages, see [`reply.py`](reply.py).
- For a basic trade framework that prints trades to stdout and auto-accepts gifts see [`trade.py`](trade.py).
- For an automatic suspicious comment deleter see [`comment_monitor.py`](comment_monitor.py).
- For integration with a discord.py bot see [`discord_integration.py`](discord_integration.py) (You'll need to install discord.py for this. `pip install discord`)
- For working with your wallet see [`wallet.py`](wallet.py) (You'll need to install babel for this. `pip install babel`)
- For a more advanced example of `ext.commands` and other functions combining to form a badge trader see [`badge_trader.py`](badge_trader.py).

###### Anyways that's all from me for now, Good luck and happy coding.
